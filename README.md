# Ensemble-_Machine_Learning_Model_Gold

The model is a ensemble of 15 different models of varying types (regression, exponential smoothing, ARIMA, and neural network).
Multiple objects were created for different visuals and dataframes for downsteam experimentation  / tweaking.
Eventually the model should evolve into a series of functions.
